# Draft

I'll write points I come out with here to start documenting the standard.

## Motivation

Java apps are very stable and have a good ecosystem, so I use Java for those
use cases so that I will be able to keep writing Java apps and have minimum
maintenance costs.

In addition to be a stable language, Java use cases are for boring apps like
enterprise systems, that is, cheap software that works well with the OOP
paradigm and general purpose languages.

Java is best qualified for these use cases in general and for me than any other
popular general-purpose language because the tradeoffs among features, breaking
changes, maintainability, etc., are well-balanced in the Java ecosystem.
